# Social Network API

The goal is to build the back end for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The application should be able to add users and the users can add thoughts. Other people should be able to react to the thoughts and add friends. They should also be able to delete or edit thoughts or the users account and remove friends and reactions.
